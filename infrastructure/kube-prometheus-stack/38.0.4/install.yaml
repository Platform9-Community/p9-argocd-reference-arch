                                    non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                    backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource
                                    and DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                    automatically if one of them is empty and the
                                    other is non-empty. There are two important differences
                                    between DataSource and DataSourceRef: * While
                                    DataSource only allows two specific types of objects,
                                    DataSourceRef allows any non-core object, as well
                                    as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While DataSource
                                    ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if
                                    a disallowed value is specified. (Alpha) Using

                        stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach.
                        When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across
                        multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin
                        is opened on container start, is empty until the first client
                        attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data
                        until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed
                        and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this
                        flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin
                        will never receive an EOF. Default is false

                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                            contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container
                            crashes or exits. The Pod''s termination grace period
                            countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed.
                            Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container
                            will eventually terminate within the Pod''s termination
                            grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management
                            of the container blocks until the hook completes or until
                            the termination grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks'

                          be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing

                                  (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is

                        (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway
                        tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location, but
                        giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce
                        the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an
                        incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment
                        for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For
                        example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                        with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2
                        | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is
                        set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to
                        zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on
                        zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster
                        can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won''t make it *more*

                                    ignores disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if
